# JavaScript Basic Programming Exercises

This set of exercises covers fundamental JavaScript programming concepts including variables, control structures, loops, and functions. The exercises are designed for students learning JavaScript basics, particularly those familiar with C programming syntax.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- JavaScript runtime environment (browser or Node.js)

## Exercises Overview

### 1. Temperature Conversion
Write a function `degreC` that converts Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius using the formula: 
```
tempC = (5/9)(tempF-32)
```

### 2. Time Conversion
- Part 1: Create a function `hjms` that converts seconds into days, hours, minutes, and seconds
- Part 2: Improve the function to handle singular/plural units and omit zero values

### 3. Number Sorting
Create a program `troisNombres` that takes three numbers as input and returns them in ascending order.

### 4. Pattern Printing - Stairs
Create two versions of a triangle pattern printer:
- `triangle1`: Using while loops
- `triangle2`: Using for loops

Example output for size 7:
```
*
**
***
****
*****
******
*******
```

### 5. Prime Number Testing
Create a program `Premier` that tests whether a given number is prime and identifies its smallest divisor if it's not prime.

### 6. Fibonacci Sequence
Two programs to work with the Fibonacci sequence:
- `Fibo1`: Calculate the nth term of the sequence
- `Fibo2`: Find the first term greater than a given value

### 7. Square Root Approximation
Implement `Raca1` to calculate the square root of a number using the iterative formula:
```
u(n+1) = (1/2)(u(n) + A/u(n))
```
Where A is the input number between 1 and 100.

## Expected Learning Outcomes
- Understanding basic JavaScript syntax
- Working with mathematical computations
- Implementing control structures
- Using loops and iterations
- Creating and using functions
- Problem-solving with algorithms

## Notes
- All input/output operations should be handled through the browser console or appropriate JavaScript interfaces
- Solutions should focus on both functionality and code readability
- Test cases are provided for each exercise to verify correct implementation
